<p>Of the many languages of India, Urdu (Hindustani) is the most widely
known, especially in Upper India. Both as a written and a spoken
language it has a reputation throughout Asia for elegance and
expressiveness. Until the time of Muhammad Shah, Indian poetry was
written in Persian. But that monarch, who mounted the throne of Delhi
in 1719, greatly desired to make Urdu the vogue, and under his patronage
and approval, Hatim, one of his ministers, and Wali of the Deccan,
wrote Diwans in Urdu. This patronage of poets was continued by his
successors, and exists indeed to the present day; and the cultivation
of Urdu poetry has always been encouraged at the many Courts of India.
Some of the Indian Rulers are themselves poets, and find their duty
and pleasure in rewarding with gifts and pensions the literary men
whose works they admire. The Court of Hyderabad has for long had a
circle of poets: the late Nizam was himself eminent as a writer of
verse. The Maharaja-Gaekwar of Baroda is a generous patron of literary
men, and the present Rulers of lesser States such as Patiala, Nabha,
Tonk, and Rampur, are deeply interested in the cultivation of poetry
in their Dominions.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries many towns in India had
extensive and flourishing literary coteries, and it is from the poets
Of that period that this handful of verses is gathered. The Mushaira&mdash;a
poetical concourse, wherein rival poets meet to try their skill in
a tournament of verse&mdash;is still an institution in India. Delhi, Agra,
Lucknow, Lahore, Cawnpore, Allahabad, Benares, Calcutta, and
Hyderabad, have all been, and some still are, nests of singing birds.
Of the extent of Urdu literature some idea may be gained from the fact
that a History of it written about 1870 gives the names of some three
thousand authors, and that Tazkiras or anthologies containing
selections from many poets are very numerous.</p>

<p>The poetry is very varied and of great interest. It includes moral
verses and counsels, sometimes in intermingled verse and prose; heroic
poems telling the old tales of the loves of Khusru and Shirin, of Yusuf
and Zuleika, of Majnun and Leila, and the romances of chivalry; elegies
on the deaths of Hasan and Hussein, and of various monarchs; devotional
poems in praise of Muhammad and the Imams; eulogies of the reigning
Ruler or other patron or protector of the poor; satires upon men and
institutions, sometimes upon Nature herself, specially upon such
phenomena as heat, cold, inundations and pestilence; descriptive verse
relating to the seasons and the months, the flowers and the trees.
Above all there is a great wealth of love poetry, both secular and
mystic, where, in impassioned ghazals or odes, the union of man with
God is celebrated under various allegories, as the bee and the lotus,
the nightingale and the rose, the moth and the flame.</p>

<p>Most of the poets represented in this book write as Sufis, or Muslim
mystics, and scoff at the unenlightened orthodox. For them God is in
all and through all, to be worshipped equally in the Kaaba and in the
Temple of the Idols, or too great to be adored adequately through the
ritual of any creed. He is symbolized as the beautiful and cruel Beloved,
difficult to find, withdrawn behind the veil, inspiring and demanding
all worship and devotion. The Lover is the Madman, derided by the
unsympathetic crowd, but happy in his ecstatic despair. He drinks the
wine of love and is filled with a divine intoxication. For him this
world is Maya&mdash;illusion, and the true life is that which is unmanifest.
He finds no abiding place in this mortal caravan-serai, this shifting
House of Mirrors; for his Soul is ever passing forward on the high
Quest. Knowledge and skill are as dust, and self as nothing, compared
with the Love that goads and urges him on.</p>

<p>As a language, Urdu has a most composite ancestry, and comprises
elements derived from the original languages of India, from Sanskrit,
the tongue of the Aryan invaders, from Persian, from Turkish, from
Kurdish and other Tartar tongues, from Arabic, even from Egyptian and
Abyssinian; and later from such very foreign sources as Portuguese,
Dutch, French, and English. The political phases through which India
has successively passed have left their record in this hybrid character
of the language. The process of its evolution really began long before
the Christian era, when Sanskrit&mdash;the language of the Aryan
conquerors&mdash;began to commingle with the languages of the peoples in
Upper India, or Hindustan. From this union came the prakrits, or
vernaculars. The one which at the time of the Buddha was current in
Magadha&mdash;parts of the present British Behar and Orissa and the United
Provinces of Agra and Oudh&mdash;was known as Magdhi, and the message
delivered by the great Teacher was recorded in that vernacular. This
spread rapidly with the growth of Buddhism, and became the court and
official language of a large part of Upper India. The language which
was developed in the north and north-west was called at first by the
simple name Bhasha (Bhakha), which means the usual tongue, but later
took the name of Hindi, and is written in the Sanskrit (Deva-nagari)
character.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the eighth century the Muslims appeared as
conquerors in India. Mahmoud of Ghuzni, about 1,000 A.D., won great
victories, and from that time Bhasha began to be modified in the towns.
Four centuries later Tamerlane of the Mogul race entered India and
took Delhi, laying the foundation of the Empire definitely established
by Babar in the beginning of the sixteenth century. Hindi became
saturated with Persian, itself already laden with many Arab words
introduced through conquest and religion. The market of the army was
established round Delhi, and bore the Tartar name of Urdu, which means
horde or army, and thus, camp. It was especially at Delhi, after its
rebuilding by Shah Jehan and its growth into the metropolis and
literary and commercial and military centre, that the hybrid tongue
took definite shape; it was named Zaban-i-urdu (literally, the
language of the army) or simply Urdu, and was written in the Persian
character. Even in its infancy it manifested a wealth of poetic
inspiration derived from its varied ancestry.</p>

<p>The poets from whose work the lyrics in this book have been selected
were mostly writers of voluminous Diwans, and they occupied various
and diverse stations in life. Some were Rulers, some soldiers, some
darweshes (devotees), some men of letters only. The name given is in
each case the takhallus (pen-name); each has some special significance,
as Sauda, the folly of love, Momin, the believer, Zafar, the
victorious; and frequently this name is introduced, by way of signature,
into the closing stanza of a poem.</p>

Kalenders, and wrote an Urdu Diwan much appreciated for the ingenious

Fragrance of many a rose&mdash;<br>

Caught in the moonlit hours<br>

Look on my face how pale!<br>
Will naught my love avail?<br>

Hold it as gold that is<br>
Cleansed of impurities<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Tried in the fire.<br>
Pity my heart distrest,<br>
Caught by that loveliest<br>

Thou, Sorrow, wilt keep and wilt cherish the memory of me<br>

For thou dwelt at my heart, and my blood nourished thee,<br>

<br>
My heart has disgraced me by clamour and wailing for years<br>

Mine eyes lost their honour by shedding these torrents of tears<br>

O Wind of Disaster, destroy not the home of my heart<br>

Had I control o'er her, the dear Tormentor,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Then might I rest;<br>
I cannot govern her, nor can I master<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The heart within my breast.<br>
<br>
I cast myself upon the ground in anguish<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Wounded and sore,<br>
Yet longed to have two hearts that she might pierce them,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    That I might suffer more.<br>
<br>
Utterly from her heart hath she erased me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    No marks remain,<br>
So there shall be no grave from which my ashes<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    May greet her steps again.<br>
<br>
O cruel One, when once your glances smote me,<br>

It were more merciful to let their arrows<br>

<br>
No tomb, Amir, could give my dust oblivion,<br>

The seer's eyes look on the cup of wine<br>

An exaltation that is more divine,<br>

O praise not peacock youth; it flits away<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And leaves us but the ashes of regret,<br>
A disappointed heart, a memory,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    An empty foolish pride that lingers yet.<br>
<br>
Upon the path, Amir, we journey far,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Weary the road where mankind wandereth;<br>
O tell me, does it lead through Life's bazar,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Or is it the dread gate and house of Death?<br>

I should not marvel if for flight<br>

My body is so gay and light<br>

By day and night forever now<br>

And ever in my home in Hind<br>

He comes to you in many a varied guise,<br>
If Him you cannot find<br>
The shame be yours, O eyes that are so blind.<br>

Forgets his petty self and wins the whole,<br>
Losing himself outright<br>
He finds himself in the Eternal Light.<br>

Through all the close entanglements of earth<br>

I linger here for but a fleeting day,<br>

From an unsympathetic world I flee<br>

How long will she thus stand unveiled before me,<br>
Shrinking and shy in maidenly distress,<br>
How long, my dazzled eyes, can ye contemplate<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Her blinding loveliness!<br>

I call on Death, for Life is my distress,<br>
And I myself a load of weariness<br>
Weighing upon myself. Helpless am I;<br>
Dared I to weep, then never would run dry<br>
The fountains of my grief: I cannot speak:<br>
Even the occupation that I seek<br>
Goads me and wearies me. A jungle drear<br>
This world and all its moving crowds appear,<br>
And I the loneliest of all things on Earth,<br>
Yea, lonely in the household of my birth.<br>
Tired am I of my suffering through the years,<br>
Even as mine eyes are wearied of their tears.<br>
Spring comes again and brings the cooling breeze,<br>
And Autumn with the rain among the trees,<br>
Fair Summer with its moonlit nights of gold,<br>
And Winter with its sweet and gentle cold;<br>
These come and go, with morn and even-fall,<br>
How can I tell how I have passed them all?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Well, I have borne them all!<br>
<br>
Hope gleamed awhile, but fled unsatisfied,<br>
The flower sprang up, but drooped and fruitless died:<br>
The silver bow of Ede shone above all,<br>
But never came the looked-for Festival:<br>
I saw the splendour of the season wane,<br>
Never the benediction of the rain<br>
Fell on my parch&eacute;d heart: the thunder loud<br>
Pealed from the bosom of the darkened cloud,<br>
But never came the long-desir&eacute;d rain:<br>
I sought the fruit upon the tree in vain,<br>
The thorn smote deep into my heart instead:<br>
Across the desert wastes of sands I sped<br>
Seeing the silver watercourses gleam,<br>
But it was all a vision and a dream,<br>
And thirsting in the desert I was left<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Lone and bereft.<br>

Now that mine eyes are opened, know I not<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Was it a thought that held me&mdash;or a dream?<br>
<br>
Long to myself I said&mdash;It will be well,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    When I can see her, I will tell my pain:<br>
Now she is here, what is there left to tell?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    No griefs remain.<br>
<br>
Faithless she is to me, and pitiless,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Despotic and tyrannical she is,<br>
I looked for love, I looked for tenderness,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I leant on vain impossibilities.<br>
<br>
I listened to thy voice that stole to me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Across the curtain where thou satst apart,<br>
Desire came like a restless ecstasy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    A sorcery that fell upon my heart.<br>
<br>
When I had burst my prison, and was free,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I saw no fetters held me, and I found,<br>
O Zafar, that these chains that shackle me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Are ties of self wherewith my soul is bound.<br>

I care not if no rest nor peace remain,<br>
I have my cherished pain,<br>
I have my rankling love that knows no end,<br>
And need no other friend.<br>
I yearned with all my heart to hold her fast,<br>
She laughed, and fled, and passed!<br>
Lakhs of enchantments, scores of spells I wove,<br>
But useless was my love.<br>
I would have given my life to make her stay,<br>
She went away, away, she went away.<br>
Though I effaced myself in deed and thought<br>
And brought myself to naught,<br>
The dark and sundering curtain hangs between<br>
I cannot pierce the screen.<br>
And still I know behind the veil she hides,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And naught besides<br>
In all this changing Universe abides!<br>

That I should find her after weary years,<br>
And that mine eyes should keep from happy tears,&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    That is not possible, this is not possible.<br>
<br>
If she should come after these many days,<br>
And if my wondering eyes forget to gaze&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    That is not possible, this is not possible.<br>
<br>
Sometimes I long to kiss my idol's face,<br>
Sometimes to clasp her in my wild embrace&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    That is not possible, this is not possible.<br>
<br>
How can I let her seek my rival's door,<br>
How can I bear the friends I loved before&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    That is not possible, this is not possible.<br>
<br>
O Zafar, does she bid me to return,<br>
And dare I, for I tremble and I burn&mdash;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    That is not possible, this is not possible.<br>

Whence did the yearning of the soul arise,<br>
The longing to attain the Heavenly Sight?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Before what mortal eyes<br>
Was manifested the Eternal Light?<br>
<br>
When the soul understands and wakes to find<br>
Thou hast within the heart of man Thy throne,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    It sees how arrogant and blind<br>
The self that but its mortal self hath known.<br>
<br>
Thou and I also were the seer and seen,<br>
When none beside existed. Thou and I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Have Lover and Belov&eacute;d been<br>
Before this era of mortality.<br>
<br>
How strange the turns in Love's unending game,<br>
For neither Lover nor Belov&eacute;d lit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The ever-burning flame:<br>
Whence was the spirit that enkindled it?<br>
<br>
The road that leads where pious pilgrims bow<br>
In Kaaba or in Temple, Thou hast laid;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And first of all wert Thou<br>
To tread the road that thou Thyself hadst made.<br>

Thy beauty flashes like a sword<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Serene and keen and merciless;<br>
But great as is thy cruelty,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Even greater is thy loveliness.<br>
<br>
It is the gift of God to thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    This beauty rare and exquisite;<br>
Why dost thou hide it thus from me,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I shall not steal nor sully it.<br>
<br>
And as thy beauty shines, in Heaven<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    There climbs upon its path of fire<br>
The star that lights my rival's way,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And with it mounts his heart's desire.<br>
<br>
Even in thy house is jealousy,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Thy youth demands the lover's praise<br>
Over thy beauty, which itself<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Is jealous of thy gracious ways.<br>
<br>
I died with joy when winningly<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    I heard the Well-Belov&eacute;d call&mdash;<br>
Zahir, where is my beauty gone,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Thou must have robbed me after all.<br>

O Tyrannous One, when from my heart was drawn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    The fatal arrow, like a scarlet flood<br>
My life gushed forth; but yet the one word Hope<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Was written in my blood.<br>
<br>
Why should the Cosmos turn its wheel of worlds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    If not to search for thee eternally?<br>
Why should the tireless Sun arise each morn<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    If not to look for thee?<br>
<br>
Alas my fate! before you came to me<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Already had I felt the touch of Death,<br>
Nor was I spared before thy worshipped feet<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To offer up my breath.<br>
<br>
For long, throughout the world, I sought for thee,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Through weary years and ages of unrest;<br>
At last I found thee hidden in my arms<br>

Each morn I see the Sun in majesty<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Come back to shine thy rival as before,<br>
But O what ages has it taken thee<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To come to me&mdash;if thou wilt come&mdash;once more!<br>

Through Love did I the joy of life attain,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And walking in the way that He hath led<br>
I found the remedy to heal all pain;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Why therefore is my pain unremedied?<br>

O burnish well the mirror of thy heart<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And make it fair,<br>
If thou desire the image of thy Love<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To shine reflected there.<br>

No fault is thine, Beloved, I do not blame thee,<br>
Nor do I blame my rivals for their part,<br>
I know my trouble causeless, yet I hearken<br>
To my unreasonable, doubting heart.<br>
<br>
<div align=right>M<small>AZHAR</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
What thou hast done, never an enemy<br>
Would practise on a bitterly-hated foe;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    And yet, my friend,<br>
I took thee for a friend, and did not know.<br>
<br>
<div align=right>M<small>AZHAR</small>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>

<br>
<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Mayhap my sorrowful heart<br>
Did not deserve thou shouldst bestow on me<br>
Thy priceless love, but neither did it merit<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Thy cruel tyranny.<br>

She lightly laughed&mdash;And so is Mazhar dead?<br>
Alas, poor helpless one! I knew not I<br>
What was his trouble.&mdash;Then again she said<br>

And if I see her not, I die;<br>
O Love, to tender hearts like mine<br>
Thou art a great calamity.<br>

I ask for Allah's pardon, if I dare<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To weigh and criticise what He hath done;<br>
But when He made thy beauty shining fair,<br>

Thou hast not in thy myriad cycles brought!<br>
Wilt thou, indeed, I wonder in despair,<br>
Bring me at last what I so long have sought?<br>

And she herself the only remedy.<br>

<br>
Only in visions can I come again<br>
To the Belov&eacute;d, and a shade she seems;<br>
My lips desire in vain<br>
The touch of ghostly kisses,<br>
The shadowy kisses that I know in dreams.<br>

O kind imagination, thou hast given<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Eyes to my heart, and though She veil her grace<br>
Fold behind fold, they seek the hidden heaven,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    They find the secret beauties of her face.<br>

<br>
<br>
I did not weep until my heart was lost,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    So strange the bartering of love appears,<br>
I gave the shining jewel of my soul<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    To buy these pearls&mdash;my tears.<br>
<br>
<br>

The eyes say in reproach, O wayward heart,<br>
What road of ruin hast thou led us in!<br>
The heart complains, O eyes,<br>
Beguiled yourselves, ye lured me into sin.<br>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
